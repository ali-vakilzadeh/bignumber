##Handling of big numbers in programming

I have developed the classes, to handle very large numbers in programming languages. It is virtually unlimited in number of digits (limited to memory allocation to text data) and it is able to perform following operations:

###1- values are stored in string format
###2- values are considered as raw integer, no floating point operations are performed.
###3- math results with floating results will be truncated to the integer part
###4- basic mathermatical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are available. more functions to release.
###5- value display function
